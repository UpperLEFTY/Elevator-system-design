This is a high level object oriented design for an Elevator System. It also includes some of the main pseudocode on how different components will work. This represents simple working structure, it's by no means optimized for a real elevator system. 
Classes needed for Elevator System: 

ElevatorManager [Singleton - This is the main elevator program which will manage n elevators in the building]
Members:
List of Elevator
Queue of Floor.Request // This maintains request for both directions. One improvement could be to keep two queues, one for each direction but it would increase complexity
MIN_FLOOR
MAX_FLOOR
Operations:
delgate()
halt() // set whole elevator system in maintenance mode or halt operation


Elevator [Represents individual elevators. There could be n elevators in a building]
Members:
Queue of Floor // this needs to be sorted so may be a PriorityQueue could be used
Direction : Enum [Enum of direction - up, down, wait, idle, maintenance]
CurrentFloor : Floor
Operations:
operate()
moveUp()
moveDown()
openDoor()
closeDoor()
callEmergencyLine()
getDirection()
getCurrentFloor()
setInMaintenanceMode()


Floor [Represents individual floors]
Members:
eNum of Floors
class Request {
currentFloor
destinationFloor
Direction [Up, Down]
}
Operation:
goUp()
goDown()


Some of the main pseudocode for above components:


``` class Floor { goUp() { ElevatorManager.queue.offer(new Request(currentFloor, destinationFloor, up)); }
goDown() {
	ElevatorManager.queue.offer(new Request(currentFloor, destinationFloor, down));
}
}

ElevatorManager { delegate() {

	// Instead of using one object, we could use a list to track idle and elevators moving in same direction so that these list could be used for next requests in queue
	// but again to simplify pseudocode, I am using single objects instead of lists
	Elevator idleElevator; // track idle elevator
	Elevator elevatorMovingInSameDirection; // elevator moving in same direction as next request in main elevator manager queue 

	while(!halt()) { //keep delegating until powered down or whole system is halted through main controls

		if(queue.peek() != null) {

			Request req = queue.peek();
			boolean startAgain = false; // flag to start from beginning if the request is already pushed to one of the elevators queue during iterating elevators

			for(Elevator elevator : elevators) {

				// first find if there is an elevator at current floor going in same direction as current request in queue
				if(req.currentFloor == elevator.currentFloor && req.direction == elevator.direction) {
					elevator.queue.offer(req.destinationFloor);
					queue.poll(); // remove this request from Elevator Manager queue
					
					startAgain = true;
					break;
				}

				// check if this elevator is idle
				if(elevator.direction == "idle")) {
					idleElevator = elevator; // For this simple design, I am ok to overwrite idle elevator value and instead get the latest idle elevatior
				}

				// check if this elevator is moving in desired direction and elevator's current floor is behind desired floor in queue
				if(elevator.direction == req.direction) {

					// Make sure elevators moving in same direction should also be behind the floor where request is made
					if(req.direction == "Up" && req.currentFloor - elevator.currentFloor > 0) {
						
						elevatorMovingInSameDirection = elevator; // Same as above, it's ok to get this overwritten and instead get the latest elevator moving in same 		direction
					}

					// Make sure elevators moving in same direction should also be behind the floor where request is made
					if(req.direction == "Down" && req.currentFloor - elevator.currentFloor < 0) {
						elevatorMovingInSameDirection = elevator;
					}
				}

			}

			// Only delegate to other floors if you could not find elevator going in same direction at same floor from where the request was made
			if(!startAgain && idleElevator != null) {
				idleElevator.queue.offer(req.destinationFloor);
				queue.poll();
			}
			
			// if we could neither find elevator at current floor nor idle elevator then send this request to elevator behind current Floor and moving in same direction as the request
			if(!startAgain && elevatorMovingInSameDirection != null) {
				elevatorMovingInSameDirection.queue.offer(req.destinationFloor);
				queue.poll();
			}


		}
	}
}
}

Elevator {

moveUp() {
	this.currentFloor += 1;
}

moveDown() {
	this.currentFloor -= 1;
}

operate() {

	while(queue.peek() != null) {

		Floor nextFloorInQueue = queue.peek();

		while(this.currentFloor != nextFloorInQueue.request.destinationFloor) {
			if(this.direction == "Up") {
				moveUp();
			} else if(this.direction == "down") {
				moveDown();
			}
		}

		queue.poll(); // remove the request from queue
		open(); //open door

		Direction backUpDirection = this.direction; //back up elevators direction to retrieve it later once dooor closes
		this.direction = "idle"; // set state to idle to let elevatorManager know that requests at current floor could be offered to this elevator queue

		Thread.sleep(10000); // sleep for 10 seconds so that people can leave elevator

		close(); // once people are out close door to move to next floor in queue
		this.direction = backUpDirection;
	}

	this.direction = "idle"; // once queue is empty set the direction to idle
}
}
